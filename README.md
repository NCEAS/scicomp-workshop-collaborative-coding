# NCEAS Scientific Computing Workshop - Template

## Repository Explanation

This repository is the template for workshops offered by NCEAS Scientific Computing Support Team. This repository (and by extension, future workshops' repositories) creates a website with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) meaning that web pages can be written with Markdown syntax. Following the steps below when creating a new workshop repository guarantees a consistent structure and aesthetic across all workshops (i.e., a consistent "brand").

## To Make a New Workshop Repository:

1. **Fork** this repository to your GitHub profile

2. **Rename** the repository by replacing "template" with 1-2 words about the workshop content
    - E.g., "scicomp-workshop-github", "scicomp-workshop-tidyverse", etc.

3. **Transfer ownership** of the repository to the [NCEAS GitHub Organization](https://github.com/NCEAS)

4. **Create content** for the workshop in separate .qmd files
    - Note that you'll need to add the names of each file to the "_quarto.yml" file for the pages to be included in the Quarto website

5. **Deploy** the website with GitHub Pages
