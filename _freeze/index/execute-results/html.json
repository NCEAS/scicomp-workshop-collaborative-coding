Specifically, **we are focusing here on an introductory approach to version control that focuses on using `git` via RStudio and GitHub**. We are always happy to improve workshop content so please don't hesitate to [post an Issue](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp-workshop-collaborative-coding/issues) on our GitHub repository if you see clear areas for improvement! \n\n<img src = \"images/logos/github_logo.png\" align = \"right\" width = \"17%\" />\n\nTo maximize the value of this workshop to you, **we recommend that you take the following steps before the day of the workshop**. Depending on whether you've used RStudio and/or GitHub before you may have already completed some or all of these steps but please read through the following materials regardless to ensure that all participants arrive with a common foundation of installed programs. If anything is unclear, feel free to reach out to us; our contact information can be found in the \"Content Creators\" tab. \n\n## Programs to Install\n\n**Note for those of you with a dedicated IT team that has sole power to install software on your computer:** you will need to contact them before the workshop to install the following programs.\n\n### R & RStudio\n\n**Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and its more convenient (in our opinion) user-interface: [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)**.\n\nIf you already have R, check that you have at least version 4.0.0 by running the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nversion$version.string\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf your version starts with a 3 (e.g., the above code returns \"R version 3...\"), please update R to make sure all packages behave as expected.\n\n### `git`\n\n**[Install `git`](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)**\n\n**If you are a Windows user**, be sure to follow along with \"Option 1\" in the instructions linked above! That variant gives some under-the-hood tools we'll implicitly rely on later.\n  \n## Accounts to Create / Connect\n\n### GitHub\n\n**[Create a GitHub account](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)** using your web browser of choice.\n\n**[Connect `git` to your GitHub profile](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)**. You may want to [review the \"shell\"](https://happygitwithr.com/shell.html#shell) (also known as the \"terminal\" or \"command line\") to help with this step.\n\n**Create a personal access token (PAT)**. A token is essentially a more secure password that `git` requires and you can create one by running the following code in RStudio:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Install the `usethis` and `gitcreds` packages\n#install.packages(c(\"usethis\", \"gitcreds\"))\nlibrary(usethis); library(gitcreds)\n\n# Add your GitHub username and email\nusethis::use_git_config(user.name = \"Jane Doe\",\n                        user.email = \"jane@example.org\")\n\n# Create a token (Note this will open a GitHub browser tab)\n# See steps 6-10 in GitHub's tutorial (link below)\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\n# Copy your Personal Access Token at the end of the above step!\n\n# Now, give your token to RStudio\n# After you run this line you'll follow some prompts in the \"Console\" tab of RStudio\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n```\n:::\n\n\nAt the end of the above steps your token should be set! For additional information, see [GitHub's PAT Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) or the [Happy Git with R PAT Tutorial](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html). If this seems a little intimidating, please keep in mind that your experience with downloading programs and creating web accounts will help with these tasks even if you have more minimal coding experience!\n\n## Websites to Visit\n\n### Supplemental Material\n\nWhile not technically necessary to attend the workshop, if you'd like you can see the content that created the workshop website you are viewing by visiting our [GitHub repository here](https://github.com/NCEAS/scicomp-workshop-collaborative-coding).\n",
