Julien advises and mentors on how to clean, structure, combine, and analyze their heterogeneous data sets, as well as scaling up their analysis while promoting open and reproducible data science principles.\nJulien is also a Lecturer in the Master in Environmental Data Science program at Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, where he teaches “good enough” practices in reproducible and collaborative data science."

His zeal for the tidyverse is born out of the number of times these tools have allowed him to untangle a rat’s nest of idiodsyncratic data and he hopes this workshop will be valuable to all participants.Nick completed his MS in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Iowa State University"
